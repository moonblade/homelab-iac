# HOMELAB - Infrastructure as Code

Homelab server infrastructure

### Log

- Jan 1, 2025

Bought a lenovo thinkcenter to use as a homelab server recently.
Messing around by installing proxmox on it and getting some vms and k3s on it.

Primary use case would be to get my finance tracking on it and try plaintext accounting with beancounter as frontend.
With sms automation to automatically put stuff into the plaintext. Will see how that goes.

But along the way want to learn nixos configurations, run k3s on it and get most of my crap thats on the rpi server on k3s instead.
I have an ubuntu vm as well on it to mess around with as a normal linux machine. Will see how it goes. Wish me luck
